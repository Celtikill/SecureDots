<summary><strong>ü§î Is This Right for You?</strong></summary>

### ‚úÖ **Perfect for:**
- Developers working with multiple AWS accounts/profiles
- Teams needing standardized credential security practices
- Organizations with compliance requirements (SOX, PCI, FedRAMP, etc.)

> **How it works:** Instead of plaintext AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`, this system encrypts everything with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) and dynamically retrieves credentials only when needed.

**Why this matters:** Traditional AWS credential files store your access keys in plaintext, visible to any process or person with file access. SecureDots eliminates this risk through encryption and optional hardware security key protection, meeting enterprise security standards while maintaining developer productivity.

## Prerequisites & Your Responsibilities

### üìã **Before You Begin**

**Required Tools** (automatically checked during setup):
- `git` - Version control and repository cloning
- `stow` - GNU Stow for dotfiles management (creates safe symbolic links)
- `zsh` - Shell environment (will be set as default)
- [`gpg`](https://gnupg.org/) - Encryption software (2.2.40+ recommended) for credential protection
- [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) - Password manager that uses GPG encryption

**Optional Tools** (for advanced features):
- [Hardware security key](https://www.yubico.com/) (YubiKey 5+ recommended) - Physical device for tamper-resistant authentication
- [`aws` CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (for AWS credential management)

#### Installation Commands

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install git stow zsh gnupg pass
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**  
```bash
sudo apt-get install git stow zsh gnupg pass
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S git stow zsh gnupg pass
```

### ‚ö° **Your Security Responsibilities**

To safely use this system, you must:

1. **üîë Secure Your Master Keys**
   - Back up GPG keys in offline, secure locations
   - Use strong passphrases for GPG keys
   - Consider hardware security keys for critical environments

2. **üîÑ Maintain Your Credentials**  
   - Rotate AWS/cloud credentials regularly
   - Monitor access logs and unusual activity
   - Keep pass store backed up with `pass git push`

3. **üìñ Understand the System**
   - Review scripts before running them
   - Follow security best practices in documentation
   - Keep software dependencies updated

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This is **your security system** - no warranties provided. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for complete legal details.

**üèóÔ∏è Deploying for Your Organization?** See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) for architecture deployment guidance.

```bash
dotfiles_help                 # See all available functions
```
**Next:** Bookmark [QUICK-REFERENCE.md](QUICK-REFERENCE.md) for daily use commands

### üîë **3. Add Your First Credentials**
```bash
# Add AWS credentials (replace 'dev' with your profile name)
pass insert aws/dev/access-key-id
pass insert aws/dev/secret-access-key

# Test the integration
aws_switch dev && aws sts get-caller-identity
```
