## First-Time Setup

<!-- Cognitive load reduction: Clear expectation setting -->
<details open>
<summary><strong>Prerequisites Check</strong> (verify before setup)</summary>

**What this does:** Checks that all required tools are installed and working.

**Expected result:** Each command should show a version number (e.g., "git version 2.34.1").

```bash
# Verify you have required tools
git --version && stow --version && zsh --version && gpg --version && pass version
```

**If any command fails:**
- **macOS:** `brew install git stow zsh gnupg pass`
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install git stow zsh gnupg pass`
- **Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S git stow zsh gnupg pass`

</details>

## Setup Commands

*Requirements:* Standard tools (git, stow, zsh, gpg, pass)

**Advanced Setup (30-45 minutes):**
```bash
./setup/setup-secure-zsh.sh
```
*What this does:* Full security setup with hardware key support, GPG configuration, audit trails.
*Requirements:* All basic tools + optional hardware security key

<!-- Post-setup validation -->
<details open>
<summary><strong>Verify Your Setup Works</strong></summary>

```bash
# Test your setup
./validate.sh
```

**What this does:** Runs comprehensive health checks to ensure everything is working correctly.

**Expected result:** All checks should show ✅ (green checkmarks). Any ❌ or ⚠️ symbols indicate issues that need attention.

### Credential Management
```bash
penv aws/dev                # Load credentials from pass store
penv_clear                  # Clear loaded credentials
pass show aws/dev/access-key-id    # View stored credential
```

### Gemini AI (Optional)

Requires opt-in via `ENABLE_GEMINI=true` in `~/.zshrc.local`.

```bash
gemini_check               # Verify credentials are set and ADC file exists
gemini_status              # Show current env var values (masked)
gemini_clear               # Clear Gemini credentials from environment
```

### Common Workflows

**Switch AWS Environment:**
```bash
aws_switch dev
aws_check
aws s3 ls                   # Test with actual AWS command
```

**Load Temporary Credentials:**
```bash
penv aws/dev                # Load from encrypted storage
aws sts get-caller-identity # Verify loaded credentials
penv_clear                  # Clean up when done
```

**Check System Status:**
```bash
dotfiles_config             # See what's configured
aws_current                 # Check current AWS profile
gpg --card-status           # Check hardware key (if using)
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

<!-- Decision tree for common problems -->
<details>
<summary><strong>Shell/Configuration Problems</strong></summary>

**Problem:** Commands like `dotfiles_help` not found

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

**If that doesn't work:**
```bash
# Manually load functions
source ~/.config/zsh/functions.zsh
dotfiles_help
```

**Expected result:** You should see the help menu with all available functions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AWS Credentials Problems</strong></summary>

**Problem:** "AWS credentials not found" or similar error

**Step 1 - Check status:**
```bash
aws_check                   # See specific error details
```

**Step 2 - Try switching profiles:**
```bash
aws_switch dev              # Re-select your profile
```

**Step 3 - Verify credentials exist:**
```bash
pass ls                     # Should show aws/profile entries
```

**If credentials are missing:** You need to add them with `pass insert aws/profile/access-key-id`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GPG/Security Problems</strong></summary>

**Problem:** GPG operations failing or hanging

**Step 1 - Check GPG agent:**
```bash
gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye  # Restart GPG agent
```

**Step 2 - Test GPG functionality:**
```bash
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign        # Should prompt for passphrase
```

**Step 3 - Check hardware key (if using one):**
```bash
gpg --card-status           # Should show card details
```

**If hardware key not detected:** Check USB connection, try different port, or verify PIN attempts remaining.
