## Our Commitment to Security

We take the security of SecureDots seriously. This local environment configuration system is designed with **enterprise-grade security architecture** that prioritizes credential protection and follows defense-in-depth principles. However, like all software, vulnerabilities may be discovered that require attention.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### üîí For Security Issues (Potential Vulnerabilities)

**Please DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues privately by email to **celtikill@celtikill.io**. This allows us to:

- Assess the impact responsibly
- Develop and test fixes before public disclosure
- Coordinate disclosure timing to protect users
- Provide you with appropriate credit for the discovery

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigations you may have

We aim to acknowledge security reports within 48 hours and provide regular updates on our progress.

### üêõ For Functional Issues (Bugs, Feature Requests)

For non-security related issues such as:
- Installation problems
- Configuration errors
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements
- General bugs that don't involve security implications

Please use our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/securedots/issues) page. This helps the community benefit from solutions and allows for collaborative problem-solving.

## Security Features

This repository implements several security measures:

- **Zero-plaintext credential storage** using [GPG encryption](https://gnupg.org/) - No credentials stored as readable text
- **Hardware security key integration** (optional but recommended) - Physical authentication devices like [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)
- **Comprehensive credential exposure prevention** through ignore patterns and [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
- **Input validation** and secure coding practices following [OWASP guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)
- **Audit trail support** through [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) git integration for tracking credential access

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for:
- ‚úÖ **Current main branch** - Actively supported
