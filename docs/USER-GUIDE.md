*Complete setup and usage reference for professional local environment configuration*

> **What are "dotfiles"?** Dotfiles are configuration files for Unix-like systems that typically start with a dot (like `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`). They customize your shell, editor, and other tools. SecureDots provides a secure, professional-grade dotfiles system with encrypted credential management.

## Before You Begin

### 📋 **Readiness Checklist**

Before starting setup, ensure you have:

**✅ Technical Prerequisites**
- [ ] Command line familiarity (basic `cd`, `ls`, `git` knowledge)
- [ ] Administrator access to install packages
- [ ] 30+ minutes of uninterrupted time
- [ ] Existing dotfiles backed up (if any)

**✅ Security Prerequisites**  
- [ ] Understanding that **you** are responsible for credential security
- [ ] Acceptance that this system requires ongoing maintenance
- [ ] Commitment to following security best practices
- [ ] Plan for GPG key backup and recovery

**✅ Tool Dependencies**

| Tool | Purpose | Check Command | Install Guide |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `git` | Repository management | `git --version` | [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) |
| `stow` | Dotfiles symlink management | `stow --version` | Package manager: `brew install stow` / `apt install stow` |
| `zsh` | Shell environment | `zsh --version` | Usually pre-installed; package manager if needed |
| `gpg` | Encryption backend | `gpg --version` | Package manager: `brew install gnupg` / `apt install gnupg` |
| `pass` | Password store | `pass version` | Package manager: `brew install pass` / `apt install pass` |

### 🎯 **Your Security Responsibilities**

**SecureDots provides enterprise-grade local configuration.** You are responsible for:

**🔑 Key Management**
- Creating secure GPG key passphrases
- Backing up GPG keys to offline storage
- Protecting hardware security keys (if used)
- Understanding recovery procedures

**🔄 Operational Security**  
- Rotating credentials regularly (quarterly recommended)
- Monitoring for unauthorized access
- Keeping dependencies updated
- Following incident response procedures

**📖 Ongoing Education**
- Reading security updates and advisories
- Understanding what the scripts do before running them
- Staying current with security best practices
- Testing backup and recovery procedures

**⚠️ Critical Understanding:** No security system is perfect. This tool helps manage credentials securely, but **you** remain the primary defense against security breaches.

```bash
# Get help and see all available functions
dotfiles_help

# AWS profile management
aws_switch dev          # Switch to development profile
aws_check              # Verify current credentials work

### Your Daily Workflow

**Morning startup:**
1. Open terminal → Shell automatically configures everything
2. Mount GPG vault (if using hardware keys)

**Working with AWS:**
```bash
aws_switch dev          # Switch to development
aws s3 ls              # Use AWS CLI normally
aws_current            # Check which account you're in
```

**Adding new credentials:**
```bash
pass insert aws/new-profile/access-key-id
pass insert aws/new-profile/secret-access-key
AWS_PROFILE=new-profile aws sts get-caller-identity  # Test immediately
```

## Common Tasks

# Edit an existing entry
pass edit aws/dev/access-key-id
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔑 Manage GPG keys and hardware tokens</summary>

```bash
# Check GPG key status
gpg --list-secret-keys

# Check hardware token (if using one)
gpg --card-status

# Test GPG functionality
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign

# Restart GPG agent if needed
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
```
</details>

### SSH Authentication (Advanced)

<details>
<summary>🔐 Set up SSH with GPG keys</summary>

**Prerequisites:** Advanced security setup with authentication subkey

```bash
# Extract SSH public key
ssh-add -L > ~/.ssh/id_gpg.pub

# Deploy to servers
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_gpg.pub user@server.com

# Test connection (will prompt for PIN/touch)
ssh user@server.com
```

**📚 See:** [GPG SSH Authentication Guide](guides/gpg-ssh-auth.md) for complete setup
</details>

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes

**Problem: "GPG command failed"**
```bash
# Restart GPG agent
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye

# Test GPG
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```

**Problem: "AWS credentials not found"**
```bash
# Check pass storage
pass ls aws/

# Verify credential process script
ls -la ~/.aws/credential-process.sh
chmod +x ~/.aws/credential-process.sh

# Test with debug mode
AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROCESS_DEBUG=true aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**Problem: "Functions not available (aws_check, etc.)"**
```bash
# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Check if functions are defined
type aws_check
type dotfiles_help
```

### Get Help

1. **📖 Check the troubleshooting guide:** [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
2. **🔍 Use built-in help:** `dotfiles_help`
3. **🧪 Run diagnostics:** Built into setup scripts
4. **📋 Collect debug info:** Use debug modes for detailed output

## System Overview

### Security Architecture

Your setup has **three main layers of security**:

1. **🔐 Encryption Layer**: GPG encrypts all sensitive data
2. **🔑 Authentication Layer**: Hardware keys (optional) provide tamper-proof storage
3. **🚫 Prevention Layer**: Configuration prevents accidental credential exposure

**Key principle:** Never store plaintext secrets anywhere
- All credentials encrypted at rest
- Dynamic credential retrieval only when needed
- Comprehensive ignore patterns prevent accidents
- Hardware keys provide tamper-resistant storage

### Key Files and Purpose

| File | Purpose | When You'll Use It |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `.zshrc` | Main shell configuration | Automatically on every terminal |
| `.aws/credential-process.sh` | Retrieves AWS credentials securely | When using AWS CLI |
| `.stow-local-ignore` | Prevents credential exposure | Automatically during setup |
| `pass` password store | Encrypted credential storage | When adding/accessing secrets |

## Migration from Existing Dotfiles

**Coming from other dotfiles?** Here's how to migrate safely:

### Backup First
```bash
# Create backup of existing configuration
cp -r ~/.config/zsh ~/.config/zsh.backup
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
cp -r ~/.aws ~/.aws.backup
```

### Migration Strategy
1. **Start with basic setup** to understand the system
2. **Import credentials** gradually using `pass insert`
3. **Customize** using `~/.zshrc.local` for personal settings
4. **Remove plaintext** credentials after verification

### Common Migration Tasks
```bash
# Import existing AWS credentials
echo "$EXISTING_ACCESS_KEY" | pass insert -e aws/profile/access-key-id
echo "$EXISTING_SECRET_KEY" | pass insert -e aws/profile/secret-access-key

# Add personal aliases to ~/.zshrc.local
echo 'alias myproject="cd ~/work/myproject"' >> ~/.zshrc.local

# Import environment variables
echo 'export CUSTOM_VAR="value"' >> ~/.zshrc.local
```
