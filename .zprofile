# Zsh loading order for login shells:
#   1. .zshenv (always)
#   2. .zprofile (login shells only) ‚Üê we are here
#   3. .zshrc (interactive shells only, but we're sourcing it manually)
#   4. .zlogin (login shells only)

# Source .zshrc to ensure consistent configuration across all shell types
# This makes login shells behave the same as interactive shells
