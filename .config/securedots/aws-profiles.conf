# AWS Profile Allowlist Configuration
# ====================================
#
# This file defines the allowed AWS profiles that can be accessed via aws_switch
# Edit this file to add or remove profiles as needed
#
# Format: One profile name per line
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# Security Note: Only add profiles you actively use to minimize risk
# Production profiles should be handled with extra care

# ============================================================================
# Profile Naming Convention (UPDATED 2025-11-05)
# ============================================================================
# - management-dev:  For developing management account features (AWS Organizations, etc.)
# - {env}-deploy:    For deploying/managing workload environments (dev, staging, prod)
#
# Account Mapping:
# - management-dev   → 223938610551 (Management account)
# - dev-deploy       → 859340968804 (Dev environment)
# - staging-deploy   → 927588814642 (Staging environment)
# - prod-deploy      → 546274483801 (Production environment)

# ============================================================================
# Active Profiles
# ============================================================================

# Management account (for org-level development work)
management-dev

# Workload deployment profiles
dev-deploy
staging-deploy

# Production (uncomment when ready to use)
# prod-deploy

# ============================================================================
# Legacy Profiles (DEPRECATED - for backward compatibility only)
# ============================================================================
# These profiles are maintained for backward compatibility during migration
# Remove these entries after you've updated all scripts and workflows

dev          # DEPRECATED: Use 'management-dev' instead
development  # DEPRECATED: Use 'management-dev' instead
staging      # DEPRECATED: Use 'staging-deploy' instead
test         # DEPRECATED: Use 'staging-deploy' instead

# ============================================================================
# Migration Notes
# ============================================================================
# Old naming:         New naming:
# dev              →  management-dev (because you use it for mgmt account work)
# (no profile)     →  dev-deploy (for actual dev environment: 859340968804)
# staging          →  staging-deploy
# test             →  staging-deploy
#
# To complete migration:
# 1. Update scripts to use new profile names
# 2. Remove legacy profile entries from this file
# 3. Remove legacy profile aliases from ~/.aws/config
